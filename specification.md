# BookShelf — Product Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** April 2026
**Status:** Final

---

## 1. Overview

BookShelf is a personal library management application. It allows users to catalog their book collection, organize books into custom collections, discover relationships between authors and their works, and gain insights into their reading patterns.

The system exposes a RESTful API that serves as the backend for any client application (web, mobile, CLI). This specification defines the data model, business rules, API contracts, and expected behaviors.

---

## 2. Core Entities

### 2.1 Author

An author represents a person who has written one or more books.

| Field | Description | Constraints |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier | System-generated, immutable |
| first_name | Author's first/given name | Required, 1–100 characters |
| last_name | Author's last/family name | Required, 1–100 characters |
| bio | Biographical summary | Optional, max 2000 characters |
| birth_year | Year of birth | Optional, integer, must be ≤ current year |
| death_year | Year of death | Optional, integer, must be ≥ birth_year if both present |
| website | Author's website URL | Optional, must be valid URL format |
| created_at | Record creation timestamp | System-generated, immutable |
| updated_at | Last modification timestamp | System-managed |

**Business Rules:**
- An author's full name (first_name + last_name) does not need to be unique — multiple authors may share names.
- Deleting an author is only permitted if they have no associated books. If books exist, the client must reassign or delete them first.
- When retrieving an author, the response must include a count of their associated books.

### 2.2 Book

A book represents a single published work in the user's library.

| Field | Description | Constraints |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier | System-generated, immutable |
| title | Book title | Required, 1–300 characters |
| isbn | ISBN-13 identifier | Optional, must be valid ISBN-13 format (13 digits), unique if provided |
| author_id | Reference to the author | Required, must reference an existing author |
| published_year | Year of publication | Optional, integer, range 1000–current year |
| genre | Book genre/category | Required, must be one of the allowed genres (see §2.2.1) |
| description | Synopsis or summary | Optional, max 5000 characters |
| page_count | Number of pages | Optional, positive integer |
| language | Language of the text | Optional, ISO 639-1 code (e.g., "en", "fr", "es"), defaults to "en" |
| rating | User's personal rating | Optional, decimal 0.0–5.0 in 0.5 increments |
| read_status | Whether the user has read it | Required, one of: "unread", "reading", "read", defaults to "unread" |
| date_added | When the book was added to the library | System-generated, immutable |
| created_at | Record creation timestamp | System-generated, immutable |
| updated_at | Last modification timestamp | System-managed |

#### 2.2.1 Allowed Genres

The system supports the following genres. This list is fixed and not user-configurable:

- Fiction
- Non-Fiction
- Science Fiction
- Fantasy
- Mystery
- Thriller
- Romance
- Horror
- Biography
- History
- Science
- Philosophy
- Self-Help
- Business
- Technology
- Poetry
- Children
- Young Adult
- Graphic Novel
- Other

**Business Rules:**
- ISBN must be unique across all books. Two books cannot share the same ISBN.
- ISBN validation: must be exactly 13 digits. The system should validate the ISBN-13 check digit algorithm.
- A book must belong to exactly one author. Multi-author books are not supported in v1.
- Deleting a book automatically removes it from all collections it belongs to.
- Rating, if provided, must be in 0.5 increments (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, ... 5.0). Values like 3.7 are invalid.
- When a book's read_status changes to "read", this is informational only — no additional side effects.

### 2.3 Collection

A collection is a user-curated list of books, similar to a playlist.

| Field | Description | Constraints |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier | System-generated, immutable |
| name | Collection name | Required, 1–200 characters, must be unique |
| description | Purpose or theme of the collection | Optional, max 1000 characters |
| is_public | Whether the collection is visible publicly | Required, boolean, defaults to false |
| created_at | Record creation timestamp | System-generated, immutable |
| updated_at | Last modification timestamp | System-managed |

**Collection–Book Relationship:**
- A collection contains zero or more books.
- A book can belong to zero or more collections.
- The order of books within a collection matters. Each book has a `position` (integer) within the collection.
- Adding a book that already exists in the collection should return an error, not create a duplicate.

**Business Rules:**
- Collection names must be unique. Attempting to create a duplicate name returns an error.
- Deleting a collection does not delete the books in it — only the association is removed.
- When a book is removed from a collection, the positions of remaining books must be recalculated to remain contiguous (no gaps).
- Collections can be reordered — the client can send a new ordering for books within a collection.

## 3. API Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON. The API uses standard HTTP methods and status codes.

### 3.1 Response Envelope

All successful responses follow this structure:

```
{
  "data": <result>,
  "meta": { ... }       // optional, present on list endpoints
}
```

All error responses follow this structure:

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "<ERROR_CODE>",
    "message": "<human-readable message>",
    "details": [ ... ]   // optional, for validation errors
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Pagination

All list endpoints support pagination with these query parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Constraints |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| page | Page number | 1 | Positive integer |
| per_page | Items per page | 20 | 1–100 |

Paginated responses include a `meta` object:

```
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total_items": 142,
    "total_pages": 8
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Sorting

List endpoints support sorting:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| sort_by | Field to sort by | Varies per endpoint |
| sort_order | "asc" or "desc" | "asc" |

Valid sort fields are specified per endpoint below.

## 4. Error Handling

### 4.1 Error Codes

The system uses the following error codes consistently:

| Code | HTTP Status | Meaning |
|------|-------------|---------|
| VALIDATION_ERROR | 422 | Request body or parameters failed validation |
| NOT_FOUND | 404 | The requested resource does not exist |
| CONFLICT | 409 | Action conflicts with existing data (duplicate ISBN, name, etc.) |
| DEPENDENCY_EXISTS | 409 | Cannot delete because dependent records exist |
| BAD_REQUEST | 400 | Malformed request (invalid JSON, missing content type) |
| INTERNAL_ERROR | 500 | Unexpected server error |

### 4.2 Validation Error Details

When a validation error occurs, the `details` array provides per-field information:

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "isbn",
        "message": "ISBN must be exactly 13 digits"
      },
      {
        "field": "rating",
        "message": "Rating must be between 0 and 5 in 0.5 increments"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4.3 Not Found

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Author with id 999 not found"
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Conflict

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "CONFLICT",
    "message": "A book with ISBN 9780060883287 already exists"
  }
}
```

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DEPENDENCY_EXISTS",
    "message": "Cannot delete author: 5 books are associated with this author"
  }
}
```

---

## 5. Data Integrity & Business Rules Summary

### 5.1 Referential Integrity

- Every book must reference a valid author. Creating a book with a non-existent `author_id` returns 422.
- Adding a book to a collection requires both the book and collection to exist.
- Deleting a book cascades to remove it from all collections.
- Deleting an author is blocked if books exist (returns 409).
- Deleting a collection removes only the associations, not the books.

### 5.2 Uniqueness Constraints

- ISBN must be unique across all books (when provided)
- Collection name must be unique

### 5.3 Timestamp Management

- `created_at` is set once when the record is created and never modified.
- `updated_at` is set on creation and updated on every modification.
- `date_added` (books only) is set once when the book is created.

### 5.4 Default Values

- `book.language` defaults to "en"
- `book.read_status` defaults to "unread"
- `collection.is_public` defaults to false

---

## 6. Seed Data

The system should be capable of being seeded with sample data for development and demonstration purposes. The seed dataset should include:

- At least 10 authors spanning different eras and regions
- At least 30 books across multiple genres, with varied ratings, read statuses, and languages
- At least 5 collections with meaningful themes (e.g., "Classics", "Science Must-Reads", "Latin American Literature", "2025 Reading List", "Short Books Under 200 Pages")
- Books distributed across collections with realistic overlap (some books in multiple collections)

The seed data must be consistent — all foreign keys valid, ISBNs properly formatted, genres from the allowed list.

---

## 7. Testing Requirements

### 7.1 Coverage Expectations

The system should have comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit tests** for all business logic (validation rules, ISBN check digit, position recalculation, statistics computation)
- **Integration tests** for all API endpoints covering:
  - Happy path (valid request → expected response)
  - Validation failures (each field's constraints)
  - Not found cases
  - Conflict cases (duplicate ISBN, duplicate collection name, delete with dependencies)
  - Edge cases (empty collections, books with no rating, searches with special characters)
  - Pagination (first page, last page, beyond last page, custom per_page)
  - Sorting (each allowed sort field, ascending and descending)
  - Filtering (individual filters and combined filters)

### 7.2 Specific Test Scenarios

The following scenarios must be explicitly tested:

1. **ISBN validation** — valid ISBN-13 passes, invalid check digit fails, non-13-digit strings fail, duplicate ISBN fails
2. **Author deletion cascade protection** — cannot delete author with books, can delete author after all books removed
3. **Book deletion cascade** — deleting a book removes it from all collections, collection book counts update
4. **Collection position management** — positions stay contiguous after removal, reorder validates the book set
5. **Search** — returns correct types, respects the `type` filter, handles minimum query length
6. **Statistics** — calculations are correct with empty database, with one item, and with realistic data
7. **Rating validation** — accepts 0, 0.5, 1.0 ... 5.0; rejects 3.7, -1, 6
8. **Pagination edge cases** — page 0 returns error, per_page 0 returns error, page beyond total returns empty data array

---

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

### 8.1 Response Times

- All single-resource operations (get, create, update, delete): < 100ms
- List operations with default pagination: < 200ms
- Search operations: < 300ms
- Statistics: < 500ms (acceptable to compute on the fly for v1)

### 8.2 Input Sanitization

- All text inputs must be trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace before storage
- HTML tags in text fields should be stripped or escaped
- The system must handle unicode characters correctly (author names, book titles in various languages)

### 8.3 Content Type

- The API accepts and returns `application/json` only
- Requests with missing or incorrect `Content-Type` header on POST/PUT should return 400

---

## 9. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1)

The following features are NOT part of v1 but may inform architectural decisions:

- Multi-author support for books (many-to-many relationship)
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Reading progress tracking (page number, percentage)
- Book cover image upload and storage
- Import/export (CSV, Goodreads, LibraryThing)
- Tags/labels (user-defined, in addition to genre)
- Book recommendations based on reading history
- Reading goals (yearly book count targets)
- Notes and highlights per book

These should not be implemented but the architecture should not make them impossible to add later.
